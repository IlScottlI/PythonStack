# Overview

Ultimately, you will complete this week with a fully functioning project that you will add to your portfolio.  **This project should include at least one feature that you taught yourself how to implement**. In a field that is constantly changing, this will give you some of the most important experience for your entire career as a developer!

On your journey, you will gain experience working with some of the core concepts of the agile development process. This will not only help you reach the your project goals on time, but will also provide a talking point with potential employers regarding the agile experience that so many tech companies seek. Your presentation provides you the opportunity to practice speaking to your work and answering questions about your code.

To earn your project badge, the requirements reflect all parts of the process, the project itself, and the presentation. Below is a checklist of the requirements that you will need in your MVP. To earn a Project Badge, the requirement is that you participate in the planning meeting, daily stand ups, and present a fully functional MVP. However, you will also be expected to include at least one additional feature not learned in class as well as making the project publicly available through deployment.

## Project Requirements

-   Overall design and quality of project is consistent with student's abilities and individual timeline.
-   Student attended and participated in the Agile Development Process including the Planning Meeting and Daily Stand Ups
-   Project MVP is fully functional with all features working
-   Project MVP contains at least one additional feature student learned outside of class
-   Project is deployed to a Public IP using AWS or github pages
