# What is the Agile Development Process?

The  **agile development process**  is a process which many tech companies use to iterate quickly and efficiently so they can continuously deploy and test new features to deliver a better product each time. [The Agile Manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org/), the original documentation for agile development, was created in 2001 and emphasizes the values of individuals and interactions, working software, customer collaboration and responding to change. Since then, these practices have become an industry standard to the extent that many job descriptions specifically seek out candidates with experience using this framework.  

# How it works

Teams typically develop features in sprints that last either 1 or 2 weeks. Each sprint consists of a planning meeting, daily stand-ups, and finishes with a retrospective meeting. Features developed during sprints are written in the form of  **User Stories**  rather than a long to do list of development tasks. User Stories have the following structure:

**As a <user role>, I want <feature>, so that <benefit>.**

This structure lends itself to completed sprints resulting in deployable features to address business concerns. Because sprints are short with frequent iteration, developers can respond to customer needs and consistently improve on their own development process.

# Implementation in Project Week

During Project Week at Coding Dojo, you will be using the basics of the agile framework. Not only will this process help with time management and finishing this week with a successful project, but it will also provide valuable experience to prepare you for your career as a software developer.

Your instructor will assign you to a group of 4 or 5 with whom you will have your planning meeting and daily stand ups to discuss your individual projects. Your retrospective will take place as part of your final presentation. We will be using the Trello platform to create and keep track of User Stories throughout the course of your project and beyond. Be sure to complete the Trello assignment and submit the wireframe for your initial MVP before the start of your planning meeting.

# What is MVP?

In software development,  **MVP**  stands for  **Minimum Viable Product**. While creating an MVP, developers decide which features of project are most important for **user experience (UX)**  while taking the least amount of time and resources to develop. Once the MVP is launched, developers will continue to add and deploy additional features as they continuously test their product and gain user feedback.  

# MVP in Project Week

Perhaps you already have an amazing idea for a website that you want to develop for your project this week! Before you dive in, make your  **Trello board**  and create your list of  **User Stories** (see the next assignment for an example). Ask yourself:  _Which of these user stories are absolutely essential to meet my project requirements by presentation day?_ This is your MVP. Any and all additional features can be added after presentations or if you manage to finish early. It is critical to keep your goals for this week attainable so you can deliver a completed project during your presentation.

# Planning Your Timeline

Once you've determined a reasonable scope for your MVP, you will need to develop a timeline for which features need to be completed on which dates. Timelines are crucial to project management. They provide transparency into your work for your instructor and teammates. Developing a timeline will also help you plan out which features need to be built first, and which features are best saved for the end so that your MVP is ready for final presentations.

Each task on your Trello board has a "due date" feature that you can use to indicate when features should be completed. We will be using this tool to practice managing our project timelines.

  

# !!WARNING!!

Creating your Wireframe, User Stories and Timelines should take  **no more than one day**. While it's true that 5 hours of planning might save you 15 days of coding, 5 days of planning will use up all of your time! Keep your ideas simple and reach out for help early on if you feel stuck during this process.

# Wireframes

Wireframes are visual concepts of website layouts used for planning. A popular platform for creating a wireframe is  [balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/). If you're not already a subscriber, Balsamiq has a one month free trial you can sign up for. Below is a tutorial to help you get familiar with the platform.

If you're already familiar with Balsamiq or perhaps you've exhausted your free trial, check out some of these other tools you can use:

# Instructions

Create a wireframe for your MVP to present at your Planning Meeting.

# User Stories and Timeline

Create a Trello board complete with User Stories to present at your planning meeting.

-   Start by clicking on  [this link](http://trello.com/)  and creating a Trello account!
-   If you need any additional help navigating the platform, check out the  [Trello Guide](https://trello.com/guide).

Remember to write  **user stories**  using the following structure:

As a <user type>, I want <feature>, so I can <benefit>.

Below is an example of how to create a Trello Board with a timeline for your project.

  <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vkTfAolT3LI" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>



- [ ]  Create 3 lists on your Trello board: To Do, Doing, and Done
    
- [ ]  Create all User Stories for features you would like to implement in your project
    
- [ ]  Highlight User Stories that are part of your MVP and need to be done before your presentation
    
- [ ]  Add a "due date" to each User Story to monitor your project's timeline

# Planning Meeting

Your initial planning meeting with your team is where you will present your idea. You will need to come to this meeting prepared with:

-   The  **wireframe**  for your MVP
-   Your **T****rello board** with user stories and due dates to indicate your timeline for completing each feature

To help you move through your meeting smoothly and efficiently, refer to the meeting outline provided below.

1.  Take turns presenting your MVP and Trello Board with User Stories. User stories should be ordered based on priority and timelines should be provided.
2.  While your peers are taking their turns, ask them important questions regarding their projects. You may need to make suggestions such as:

-   Reducing the scope of the MVP
-   Timeline adjustments
-   Adding additional User Stories if their MVP doesn't meet project requirements
-   Breaking down User Stories that are too broad

Prior to starting your planning meeting, one team member should be designated as the scribe. This person's responsibility will be to fill out the following document and submit it to your instructor at the end of the meeting.

# Daily Stand Ups

Daily Stand Ups are an important part of the agile process. Each team member should take turns updating everyone on:

1.  What they accomplished on their project the previous day.
2.  What they plan to accomplish today.
3.  State whether or not they are still on track for their scheduled timeline.
4.  Mention if there are any major problems they've run into that might be preventing them from moving forward.

If the presenter has deviated from their timeline, group members should help advise the presenter on how to manage their time moving forward. This may involve revisiting the presenter's Trello board. Teams should also give advice on when is a good time to notify the instructor about this to gain additional help.

The prompts below offer some additional guidance on how to report on progress and give feedback during a Stand Up meeting.

## Daily Stand Up Structure and Prompts

Giving an update:

-   “Yesterday I accomplished _________________________________________.”
-   “Today I will complete _____________________________________________.”

Reporting on progress and initial timeline

-   “Thus far my project is on time”
-   “I am falling behind on __________________________ because ________________.”
-   “To catch up, I will ________________________________________________.”
-   “I’m not sure how to go about completing my project on time, I would appreciate some input on how to finish on time”.

Asking for technical help:

-   “If anyone has time after this meeting, I’m really stuck on __________________. I’ve tried ____________, ________________, and _________________ and I would appreciate additional guidance.”

# Peer Feedback Form

Create a peer feedback survey using Google Forms to distribute to your peers in the chat before you present! This is your opportunity to gain perspective into your own work and presentation. You may use the example below as your form if you choose. One or two questions is ideal, and at most three, since people will be filling these out during presentations.

To make a google form, go to  [forms.google.com](https://forms.google.com/). If you do not have a google account you can also make one with a Microsoft / outlook account at [forms.microsoft.com](https://forms.microsoft.com/).
