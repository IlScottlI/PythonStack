# Why Build a Project?

Projects provide you the opportunity to demonstrate the skills listed on your resume to your future employers. During the hiring process, hiring managers will look at the projects highlighted in your portfolio to decide whether or not to bring you in for an interview. Once you've scored that interview, your projects are going to become some of your most critical talking points. Your interviewer, likely having already taken the time to read deeply into your portfolio, will probably ask questions about your code and the challenges you faced during the process. Having a well developed portfolio with a few high quality projects is going to be crucial to landing your dream job as a developer.

**To summarize**:

-   Projects present evidence of the current skills and abilities listed on your resume.
-   Employers will weight your portfolio heavily when deciding whether to bring you in for an interview.
-   Interviewers will ask questions about your projects including the challenges you faced and technical questions about your code.

# Course Objectives

Over the next week or so, you will design and build a project to demonstrate your skills, learn the basics of the Agile process, and participate in a formal presentation and Q&A session to help you better prepare for interviews. Successful projects:

-   are well planned
-   have a reasonable scope for your given timeline
-   have a fully functioning minimum viable product (MVP)
-   include at least one feature learned in class
-   get deployed!

In order to make your project stand out, here are some ideas for building a web application that will impact society. Keep in mind, the the reason for building projects is to showcase your skills and build something you're proud of. So if none of these resonate with you, feel free to be creative and create your own adventure!

### Environmentalism

Do you have an idea that would help society live in a more sustainable way? Create a project that makes “going green” a reality. This can include, but is not limited to:

-   Reducing or monitoring carbon emissions
-   Helping protect endangered species
-   Reducing pollution or helping clean local neighborhoods or cities
-   Ensuring everyone has access to clean drinking water and healthy food to eat
-   Preventing deforestation or driving reforestation
-   Improving waste disposal
-   Improving the recycling process or recycling adoption

### In-Need Individuals

Are there communities or groups of individuals you want to support? Create a project that helps those in our society who need it most. This can include, but is not limited to:

-   Supporting homeless individuals to find housing, food/water, employment, etc.
-   Helping the hungry
-   Improving access to financial services or employment for impoverished individuals
-   Helping veterans with PTSD or other service-related afflictions

### Choose Your Own Cause

-   Is there a different charity or non-profit that you support? Identify an organization working with an issue that you’re passionate about, then create a project that will help them reach their mission.

### Choose Your Own Adventure

-   Think of your hobbies, is there something you can build that can help with some aspect of a hobby or interest of yours?
-   When in doubt, you can also work on a profile page for yourself.

### Business Oriented App

-   It’s always easy to convey the usefulness of a kind of app that is well known to business people during an interview, such as a Customer Relationship Management (CRM) app.
