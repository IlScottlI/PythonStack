# Project Guideline

## Intro

## Working on your project

We see that having at least 3 strong projects and a strong portfolio site is required for those looking to make a career switch. Each of your projects must be more comprehensive than the assignments you've done. Here are things to remember.

## Before you work on your project

Please remember to get your belt first. Knowing the materials in the platform are critical to building any project. You must first get the knowledge and then apply the knowledge by building your project.

## What Project to Work on

1.  Please either work on the e-commerce system, User Dashboard, or employee clock in/out system.
2.  If you have another project idea to work on, please sketch it out on the whiteboard/paper, use Balsamiq or Powerpoint to layout how your website would look like and get your instructor to approve your wireframe no later than 24 hours after you've started working on your project.

-   User Dashboard: [user-dashboard.pdf](https://s3.amazonaws.com/General_V88/boomyeah/company_209/chapter_3834/handouts/chapter3834_6841_user-dashboard.pdf)

## While Working on the Project

Please do NOT build any of the backend features immediately. Please create a folder where you create a bunch of html files and a static folder containing all of your css files, image files, and javascript files. This should be very similar to how you've created html and css pages during your Web Fundamentals. Once you have this all of the pages built (which is essentially your clickable prototype), then create ERD, and then add the backend codes using Django or Flask.

At least 30-50% of your project time should be spent on building this clickable prototype and building out the ERD.

Please use Bootstrap or Foundation to make it look professional. If you're interested in front end, it's a great idea to make your site responsive (at least the first few pages).

## Towards the end of your project week

You may not finish all the features (it always takes longer to build than what everyone first imagines). Please do not get discouraged as you can finish the features later on. Do look at this as an opportunity to apply and combine all of the concepts you've learned and do reflect back to recognize how much you've learned and grown over the last few weeks.

Please do present your project at the end of the project week and also show your ERD. Even if you don't have all the features built, you can always present your clickable prototype.

# File Uploading

## Objectives:

-   Learn how to upload files with Django
-   Practice reading and interpreting official documentation

----------

If you have extra time, please spend up to 3 hours to see if you can figure out how to have a file uploaded through Django. You would need to have a form in the template file that allows the users to select which file to upload. Once the form is submitted, you can validate and then figure out how to save the file to your server!

Here's the documentation for reference.

-   [Django v1.1](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.11/topics/http/file-uploads/)
-   [Django v2.2](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/topics/http/file-uploads/)
-   [Django v3.0](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/topics/http/file-uploads/)

# Assignment: Face Detection

## Objectives:

-   Learn about face detection

----------

If you're done with all the previous assignments and have extra time, spend some time to learn OpenCV and see if you can build something cool using Django! This is a really hard challenge so don't feel bad if you get stuck and only work on this if you have a lot of extra time before moving on to the next chapter.

As Machine Learning has gained a lot of traction over the last few years and as Python has gained even more popularity as a lot of data scientists use Python for their data science/machine learning work, you'll find quite a few open source libraries in Python that do some pretty amazing work. Some of their documentations and tutorials may not be easy to read (for now) and may be quite challenging but if you're up for the challenge, spend some time glancing over the articles below and see if you can build something cool using Django and OpenCV.
